## Want to know more about Delphi? 
Delphi allows you to create programs which work natively on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android and the web. It's easy to learn and use. If you're not using it to develop your applications you're probably working too hard.

## Where can you see my work?

Most of my daily work is for software houses and is generally covered under one or more NDAs.  Not only can I not show it I usually can't even talk about it.  The repos for that work are private so you (hopefully) can't see them - I am a very prolific coder and I have a **lot** of repos üòÄ

However, nearly everything else I do is Open Source and public.  You can either find it on my GitHub profile here, the [official Embarcadero blog](https://blogs.embarcadero.com), or at my [own blog](https://www.codedotshow.com/blog/) website.

My CodeRage code is always available via Embarcadero or on my work website.

## Background

I've lived a rich and varied life (so far) and have a broad range of interests and activities.  Apart from the software development I'm also a professional voice actor / narrator.  You'll find me narrating audiobooks on Audible, Amazon and the iTunes Bookstore as well as other outlets, and as a voice-over for various sales and demonstration videos.

I also write poetry and have been published in dozens of anthologies, magazines as well as four books of my own.  I used to perform as part of the BardCore spoken word troupe and have appeared in various festivals, events and workshops as well as a few stately homes. 

 
 I was born in London, England.  In 2009 I emigrated to the USA.  I now live in Dallas, Texas.  I became a US Citizen in 2013.  I'm married to an American with an American daughter.  No I haven't lost my cute British accent.

You can catch me live-streaming in various places across the internet as well as at CodeRage, Embarcadero Academy and YouTube.  

## Blogging

I also have a blog with replays and code examples at <a href="https://www.codedotshow.com/blog" target="_blank">CodeDotShow.com</a>.

Sometimes my dogs think it's hilarious to join in by shouting death-threats at passing Pit Bull terriers.  Sorry, (not sorry).  Dogs rule.
